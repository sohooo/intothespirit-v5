Favbuster is a Ruby Script which "un-favorites" all the tweets you marked as favorite. While on the go I favorite tweets as some kind of bookmarking mechanism. Later at home I can check out the links of those favs or write a reply.

For me, this workflow has the nice side-benefit of heavily minimizing the time I spend with Twitter, thus eliminating another potential time sink.

The script walks you through the Twitter OAuth setup.

This is how you use it:

    ruby favbuster.rb 
    deleting the following tweets:
