# About This Site
This is the __5th incarnation__ of intothespirit. It is a place where I

* show some of the projects I'm working on
* release some utilities I use
* embrace minimalist webdesign

# Backend
This site is based on [nanoc3](http://nanoc.stoneship.org), a web framework for Ruby hackers.
It compiles into pure HTML. No javascript (keeping it simple). Ultra-fast and light. No database. No headaches. Host anywhere.

The source this site is based on is available from the [nanoc3_blog](http://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog) github repository of [mgutz](http://mgutz.com), licenced under the [FreeBSD License](/license.html).
